# SERVICES-LINK - Service Provider Web App

**PROJECT OWNER:** VIRGINIA MANEGENE

## Problem Statement

Finding reliable and professional service providers can be time-consuming and frustrating. As a result, most people rely on word-of-mouth or social media, which often lacks transparency, credibility, and booking options. On the other hand, service providers struggle to showcase their skills and services to potential clients.

## Solution

ServiceLink web app will provide a platform where potential clients can easily find and book local service providers.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

* List of service categories (e.g., cleaning, make-up, plumbing).
* Provider details (e.g., name, contact info).
* "Book Now" button.

## Target Users

Individuals or companies looking for reliable service providers.

## API Details for ServiceLink

The ServiceLink API manages service providers, categories, and bookings.

* **Temporary API (MockAPI):**
